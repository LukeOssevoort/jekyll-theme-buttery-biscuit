        <p>This theme lets you put a bit of homepage content before the feed. It only appears on the first page of the paginated feed.</p>

        <h2>Columns</h2>
        <p>
            This theme uses the css framework <a href="https://jenil.github.io/chota/">chota</a> providing lightweight and reactive columns, allowing for fun layouts that still look good on mobile.

    <div class="col">
        <h2>Themes</h2>
        <p>
            The chota framework uses html variables to define colours and spacing. Buttery Biscuit uses this to let users define themes using sass files. These themes can be used to define the chota variable and also inject custom css. Themes are selected in the _config.yml
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
        <h2>Dark Mode</h2>
        <p>
            Buttery Biscuit includes support for a dark mode theme using the theme files. For simplicity the darkmode theme only defines the chota variables for dark mode.
